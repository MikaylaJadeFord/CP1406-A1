<h2> CP1406 - Assignment One </h2>
<h3> Goals </h3>
<p> To improve business and hopefully increase the amount of customers coming to games by at least 50%, also to increase the public's knowledge about their local volleyball club. Since parents, teenagers, and other adults get most of their information off the Internet, the business I am creating this website for wants to spread the word that there is a beach volleyball company in the local area without having to only rely on word-of-mouth from current clients or spend too much money on printing for posters that would potentially be ruined by weather or be hidden by other posters. </p>
<br>
<h3> Success Evaluation </h3>
<p> The only way the business will be able to know if the website is working is if people sign up online for beach volleyball or contact them by phone, fax, email, or in-person asking for more information that may not have been on the website. I do know the website is what the client wanted because they wanted more people to know about beach volleyball, and teenagers with 24/7 access to the Internet can easily find the website. If the website doesn't work as well as the business had hoped, they can try advertising on social media(linking the ad to the website), television or radio, suggesting to the viewers to check out their website for more information.</p>
<br>
<h3> Target Audience </h3>
<p> The target audience for this website is anyone between the ages of 15 and 35 who are interested in playing volleyball professionally or for fun, and for parents with children younger than 15. The company already has 35 to 50 year olds participating in beach volleyball, so they want to be able to get teenagers and adults under 35 to give their company and beach volleyball a go.
<br>
I intentionally designed this website to have a sandy background to appeal to the target audience who usually spend weekends on beaches anyway with friends while sunbaking. I also made it as minimalistic as possible as to not overload the viewers with too much information and give them a headache. </p>

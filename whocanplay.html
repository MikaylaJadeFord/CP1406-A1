<p> Volleyball is a low impact sport played by two teams on either side of the net on the court. Volleyball originated in the United States, and is now becoming a popular sport, just ranking behind Soccer among participation sports. The objective of the game is for each of the teams to send the ball over the net to ground on the opposing teams court while protecting their side of the court. The teams are allowed to hit the ball three times within their own court before having to hit the ball over the other side of the net for the opposing team. A player is not allowed to hit the ball two times consecutively, except when attempting a block the other team. </p>
<p> The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, they gain a point and the right to serve the next ball, and its players rotate positions clockwise. 
The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage. </p>
